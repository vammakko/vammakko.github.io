      <h2>Tabby Cat</h2>
      <p>
        A tabby cat, or simply tabby, is any domestic cat
        <em><strong>(Felis catus)</strong></em>
        with a distinctive M-shaped marking on its forehead, stripes by its eyes
        and across its cheeks, along its back, around its legs and tail, and
        characteristic striped, dotted, lined, flecked, banded, or swirled
        patterns on the body: neck, shoulders, sides, flanks, chest, and
        abdomen. The four known distinct patterns, each having a sound genetic
        explanation, are the mackerel, classic or blotched, ticked, and spotted
        tabby patterns.
        <br /><br />
        "Tabby" is not a breed of cat but a coat pattern found in many cat
        breeds. It is very common amongst non-pedigree cats around the world.[1]
        The tabby pattern occurs naturally and is connected both to the coat of
        the domestic cat's direct ancestor and to those of its close relatives:

        <br>
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wildcat" target="_blank">European wildcat</a> <em><strong>(Felis silvestris)</strong></em>,
        <br>
        and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_wildcat" target="_blank">Asiatic wildcat</a> <em><strong>(Felis lybica ornata)</strong></em>,
        <br>
        all of which have similar coats, both by pattern and coloration. One
        genetic study of domestic cats found at least five founders.[2][3]
